# Portal

The Portal game ported to Unity using URP for rendering the portals, while using Blender and SketchUp for animating and improving textures. Simply downloading the project
importing it in Unity and then upgrading to the latest version should work. Fixed the delay bug of the original project, converted it to URP from LWRP and experimented with teleporting objects and in some cases the player. Also added a chell model with simple animations, cube models, a button and gate model and a gun model. The portals don't yet work on all rotations. Current version: 2020.1.5f1
